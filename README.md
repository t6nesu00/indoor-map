# Indoor map with LeafletJS

## Idea and planning of the project
### The main purpose of the project was to develop a web interface to locate the sensors according to their latitude and longitude and display the real time data received from them in a web map. The sensors are situated in a selected room and they send the data via web socket and that data is received on client side with the help of python file. The data sent by the sensors includes the information regarding the height, temperature, geo location, time, and temperature of the room. This project would enable the study of the condition of rooms remotely which can help while reacting in emergency such as fire accidents.
